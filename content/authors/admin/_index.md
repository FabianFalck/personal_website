Hi and welcome! I am Fabian - great to have you here!

I am a third year PhD student in Statistical Machine Learning in the [OxCSML group](https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at University of Oxford, supervised by [Prof. Chris Holmes](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/) and [Prof. Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/). 
I am also a [Graduate Teaching and Research Scholar in Computer Science](https://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/people/fabian-falck/) at Oriel College, University of Oxford, teaching maths courses. 
In summer 2022, I interned with the Amazon Web Services AI Lab in Berlin, Germany, advised by Dr. Jan Gasthaus and Richard Kurle.

My research interest lies in probabilistic deep learning, generative modelling, causal inference, and applications in health. 

Recently, I have worked on analysing the regularisation property of U-Nets, which are widely used in generative modelling, and hierarchical variational autoencoders (NeurIPS 2022 oral, to appear). 
I also studied [generalising the propensity score theory to balancing scores in matching for treatment effect estimation in causal inference](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/clivio22a/clivio22a.pdf) (AISTATS 2022), 
and [variational autoencoders for clustering to find multiple partitions of high-dimensional data](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/48cb136b65a69e8c2aa22913a0d91b2f-Paper.pdf) (NeurIPS 2021).   

Before joining Oxford, I worked with [Prof. Andrew Davison](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/) in computer vision and robotics at the [Dyson Robotics Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/dyson-robotics-lab/), and [with Dr. Petar Kormushev](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.kormushev) at the [Robot Intelligence Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/robot-intelligence/) both at Imperial College London. 
I also worked with [Prof. Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/) on machine learning for health at the [Auton Lab](https://autonlab.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University. Selected publications are on
a [comparison of view-based and map-based semantic labelling in real-time SLAM systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10342) (ICRA 2020),
an [exoskeleton for teleoperation called DE VITO](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-23807-0) (TAROS 2019 - the UK's largest robotics conference, Best Paper Award), 
a [software architecture and play fetch demo for Robot DE NIRO](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2020.00066/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field&journalName=Frontiers_in_Robotics_and_AI&id=466867)  (journal Frontiers in Robotics and AI; IROS workshop (spotlight)) 
and hemorrhage diagnosis with recurrent neural networks at the NeurIPS 2018 ML4H workshop (spotlight).

I studied Computer Science (MSc) at Imperial College London, 
and Engineering (BSc+MSc) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. 
During my degrees, I studied at and visited Tsinghua University (清华大学) in Beijing, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学), 
the University of Oxford, Singapore Management University, and Carnegie Mellon University in the US.

I play the guitar, enjoy singing and racket sports.
I speak English, German and Chinese. 

Do reach out to me if my research is of interest to you, or you would like to collaborate!
